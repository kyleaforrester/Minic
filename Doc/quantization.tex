\title{Static post-quantization inside Minic}
\author{Vivien Clauzon}

\maketitle
The net is trained using only floating point weight and bias.
Let's formalize the action of each layer by
$$y_i = \text{ClippedReLU}(W_i y_{i-1} + b_i , 0, 1)$$
The lower bound 0 of the clipped ReLU will now be omitted.
Let assume that $W \in ]-\alpha, \alpha[$.
We define $f = n/\alpha$ the quantization factor.

\section{Input layer}

For the input layer, the input data are named $x$. Let's apply the quantization factor.
$$\tilde{y_0} = fy_0 \approx \text{ClippedReLU}(\tilde{W_0} x + \tilde{b_0} , f)$$
with $\tilde{W} = Wf$ and $\tilde{b} = bf$.
I order to use the full range available in the upper bound of the ReLU, we now multiply by $\alpha$; 
$$\bar{y_0} = \alpha \tilde{y_0} \approx \text{ClippedReLU}(\bar{W_0} x + \bar{b_0} , n)$$

with $\bar{W} = \lfloor Wf\alpha \rfloor = \lfloor Wn \rfloor$ and $\bar{b} = \lfloor bf\alpha \rfloor = \lfloor bn \rfloor $.

As $\bar{W}$ can be bigger than int8 it will be stored in int16.
As $\bar{b}$ is not too big, nor $\bar{y_0}$, it will be stored in int16.

\section{Inner layers}
Inner layers work the same way.
$$\tilde{y_i} = fy_i \approx \text{ClippedReLU}(\tilde{W_i} y_{i-1} + \tilde{b_i} , f)$$
with $\tilde{W} = Wf$ and $\tilde{b} = bf$. Again we will multiply by $\alpha$ to get will range on the upper bound.
$$\bar{y_i} = \alpha \tilde{y_i} \approx \text{ClippedReLU}(\tilde{W_i} \alpha y_{i-1} + \tilde{b_i}\alpha , n)$$
In order to identify $\bar{y}_{i-1}$ we multiply and divide the ReLU value by $f$, so that
$$\bar{y_i} = \alpha \tilde{y_i} \approx \text{ClippedReLU}\left(\frac{\tilde{W_i} \alpha f y_{i-1} + \tilde{b_i}\alpha f}{f}, n\right)$$
We substitute
$$ \alpha f y_{i-1} = \bar{y}_{i-1}$$
$$\bar{y_i} = \alpha \tilde{y_i} \approx \text{ClippedReLU}\left(\frac{\tilde{W_i} \bar{y}_{i-1} + \tilde{b_i}\alpha f}{f}, n\right)$$
$$\bar{y_i} \approx \text{ClippedReLU}\left(\frac{\bar{W_i} \bar{y}_{i-1} + \bar{b_i}}{f}, n\right)$$

with $\bar{W} = \tilde{W} = \lfloor Wf \rfloor$ and $\bar{b} = bf^2\alpha = \lfloor b n^2/\alpha \rfloor$.  Weights can now fit to int8. Bias will be stored int32 to give space for the computation.

\section{Output layers}

It works exactly as for inner layer but we want to scale to centi-pawn the output and don't use ReLu.

$$\alpha \tilde{o} = \alpha f o \approx \frac{\tilde{W_i} \bar{y}_{i-1} + \tilde{b_i}\alpha f}{f}$$
In fact, what is computed by the last layer is
$$\bar{o} = \alpha f \tilde{o} = \alpha f^2 o \approx\tilde{W_i} \bar{y}_{i-1} + \tilde{b_i}\alpha f$$

We are looking for 
$$600\times o = \bar{o} \frac{600}{f^2\alpha} = \bar{o}/s$$
$s = \frac{f^2\alpha}{600}$ is the output scale factor.

\section{Some "real" numbers}

For int8 quantization, $n=127$. Standard weights can be clamped to $\alpha = 2$, so that $f = 127/2 \approx 64 = 2^6$, $\alpha f^2 \approx 8128$ and $s = (f^2\alpha)/600 \approx 13$.
